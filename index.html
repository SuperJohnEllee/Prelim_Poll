	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Democracy</h1>
	<div class="democ"> LAST November, more than five million Filipinos went to the polls to vote on candidates for a variety of national and local offices. The fact itself was not news in the Philippines or abroad; Filipinos have been voting since 1906. Since 1940, however, there has been a growing truth about Philippine elections which could be news but which not even all Filipinos have come to realize: the process of elections in the Philippines is the most difficult in the world. <br> The reason for this is to be found in a unique combination of things--a territory more challenging and a political system more demanding than those of any other working democracy today.</div>

	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Federalism</h1>
	<div class="democ"> Federalism is a proposed type of government wherein sovereignty is constitutionally divided between the national government and subdivisional governments (such as states or provinces). Federalism divides the country into several autonomous states with a national government.</div>


	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Vision</h1>
	<div class="democ"> The Office of the President shall be the embodiment of the Filipino peopleâ€™s highest aspiration for a government, one that promotes and sustains an environment of peace and security, inclusive growth, public accountability, genuine compassion and meaningful change towards a just social order.</div>


	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Mission</h1>
	<div class="democ"> The Office of the President shall be fully responsive to the specific needs and requirements of the President as Head of State and Government, Chief Executive and Commander in Chief.</div>
